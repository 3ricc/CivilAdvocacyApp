Tapping on a politician will open a new activity that details their information that is called from an API

Tapping on any of the links will create a new intent relative to what was tapped (e.g. tapping on the twitter link will open up Chrome/Twitter to their twitter page)

Tapping on their picture will open up a new activity for a bigger sized picture

You can change your location by hitting the search icon and it will refresh the lists of politicians from that location instead
